## Overview

**Project Title**: Music Player

**Project Description**: A web app that stores playlists with old songs that I would enjoy and plays the video inside the page.

**Project Goals**: To understand Node js and React, strengthen my knowledge in web development and create my own "music storage".

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download Node and React. Making sure to have the npm package in the directory.
2. Opening a new terminal and going to the folder with the react app (cd music in this case).
3. Running the command "npm start".

Instructions for using the software:

1. For now the way to use the software is by using the npm starter.
2. After the page opens on the server, select a song.
3. Use the search bar to know in which playlist the song is.
4. Close the video when you are done.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* You need to install Node, I installed the version v22.15.1
* Install the npm package, version 10.9.2

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [I was thinking about having a random happy songs slideshow, so using a random selection of songs or "Trending songs" in the home page.] 
* [Adding a database with old songs or most popular songs by year.]
* [Instead of having the playlists show up with all the songs listed I wanted to make the playlist name a button and when clicked it shows the songs, that would give my search bar more functionality.]
